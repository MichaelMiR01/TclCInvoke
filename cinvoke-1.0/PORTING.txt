Here are the 4 (over-simplified) steps to port C/Invoke to a new architecute:

1) copy lib/arch/empty_empty_empty.c and .h to files named
<compiler>_<cpu>_<os>.c and .h.  Add an entry to the main cinvoke-arch.h
file to include your new file.
2) Implement the new arch files.  Use the comments inside the empty files for
guidance, the other arch files for examples, and the cinvoke-dev mailing list
for help.
3) Get the source building.  If your chosen platform is POSIX-based, you can
modify configure.pl to adapt the Makefile system to your architecture.  The
build system is exquisitely simple: each directory has a Makefile.templ which
gets evaluated as a perl string and substituted with the variables in the
configure.pl script.
4) Get the test suite in the test/ directory running and spitting out the
correct values.
